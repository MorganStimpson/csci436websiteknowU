                <ul>
                    <li>What is the problem</li>
                    <p> - A large portion of our global population are affected by one or more mental disorders. Many
                        mental
                        disorders may ultimately lead to suicide. We hope to tackle this problem by means of early
                        mental
                        health intervention, the early detection and response to mental disorders. If we can identify
                        those
                        who are in distress, we may move towards providing them professional care and, hopefully,
                        ultimately
                        reduce the suicide rate and improve quality of life.</p>
                    <li>What are we tyring to solve</li>
                    <p> - </p>
                    <li>Which SDG goals are we tryign to achieve?</li>
                    <p>-This project is centered on the third SDG goals, Good Health and Well-Being. </p>
                    <li>Why is this an important problem? Is there any global impact?</li>
                    <p> - Itâ€™s estimated by the WHO that depression alone affects over 264 million people of all ages.
                        Depression is only one of the several mental disorders that many are affected by globally. For
                        our
                        project, our target users will be those who are willing and able to be a helping hand to others.
                        Specifically, we will target key social media platforms and their respective demographics. Our
                        project will enable users to be more aware of their friends and families who may be silently in
                        distress. Depression and other mental disorders may lead to suicide where the WHO estimates that
                        800,000 people die from annually; Suicide is the second leading cause of death for young adults.
                        Therefore, if our solution works we stand to affect a huge portion of our global community and
                        may
                        prevent hundreds of thousands of suicides each year.</p>
                    <li>Who are the target users? Why should they care?</li>
                    <p> - We are focused on helping folk that are using social media daily and track their habits. These
                        folk should care because the use of social media has shown have changes in peopels moods.</p>
                    <li>How many people will benefit from your solution? Give evidence of yoru claim:</li>
                    <p> - Anyone that uses social media will benefit from using our product. Being able to follow what
                        you are doing online and reflecting on your ussage.</p>
                    <li>What is your solution?</li>

                    <li>What tech have you used? Why?</li>
                    <p> - We used react native to develop the app and have it be open source so people can track the
                        root of their work.</p>
